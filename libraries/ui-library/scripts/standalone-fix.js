// Since Angular 19, standalone components are the default. However, the Stencil Angular
// output target with output type 'component' does not set the standalone property at all.
// This was acceptable before Angular 19, but now it needs to be explicitly set to false
// for compatibility with NgModule-based applications that have not migrated to standalone.

// This script adds the standalone property to all generated proxies. This can be removed
// as soon as the Stencil output target is fixed. See https://github.com/stenciljs/output-targets/issues/648
