# Introduction

The Web Components Library is an **in-house open source** project for developing modern web applications that
follow the SIX corporate styling guidelines.

The technology stack is based on web standards and best practices. Moreover, we try to keep it as simple
as possible for our developers. For those reasons we decided to use [Web Components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components),
which are supported by all modern browsers. The project fully supports [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

If you found a bug or something doesn't work as expected feel free to open a [Github Issue](TODO)

## Install
To use the SIX Web Components in your project you need to log into artifactory first to obtain an access token.
In the second step just add the library as a dependency to your package.json. Both can be done with:
```bash
npm install @six/ui-library --save
```
After the download is finished just follow the instructions for the specific framework your project is build with:
[Angular](angular.html), [React](react.html) or [Vue](vue.html)

## Contribute
We are very happy about new developers joining our small [team](aboutus.html)! If you found a bug in our code or want to contribute
some components or features get write access to the repository and...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/six-group/six-webcomponents.git
cd six-ui-webcomponents
npm install
npm run build
```

After the build was successful you're ready to go:
1. Create a feature/bugfix branch with your code changes
2. Push your branch to the repo and open a pull request. Please add some comments and a description.
3. Please make sure your branch is passing the bamboo build and wait until one of the [core developers](aboutus.html#core-development) approves your pull request.
4. Merge into the develop branch and wait until a new release is available. Finally, add the library as a dependency to your project :)

#### Git Workflow
We follow the [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/de/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow
as our git branching model. More can be read on the linked wiki page but in short gitflow works like this:
- we have a **master** branch which reflects production - in our case the latest release of our library
- we have a **develop** branch where active development happens
- we have **feature** branches which we branch out from develop and merge them back there
