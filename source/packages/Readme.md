## Creation a new version

Use `npm version [ major | minor | patch ]` to create a new version, where 
given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

See [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for more details.
