# Introduction

The Web Components Library is an **in-house open source** project for developing modern web
applications that follow the SIX corporate styling guidelines.

The technology stack is based on web standards and best practices. Moreover, we try to keep it as
simple as possible for our developers. For those reasons we decided to use
[Web Components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components), which are supported by all modern
browsers. The project fully supports [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

## Add the Components to your Project

```bash
npm install @six-group/ui-library
```

::: info

If you want to try the latest version of the software, you can install the insider releases by
specifying the _insider_ tag. For instance `npm install @six-group/ui-library@insider`
