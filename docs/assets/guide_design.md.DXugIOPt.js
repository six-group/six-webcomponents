Example: <a href="/six-webcomponents/components/six-header.html">header</a></p></li><li><p>Templates are page-level objects that place components into a <a href="/six-webcomponents/components/six-root.html">layout</a> and articulate the design’s underlying content structure.</p></li><li><p>Pages are specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place.</p></li></ol><p>Being able to <strong>reuse</strong> basic components is a huge advantage in atomic web design. Recycling atoms saves designers time while upholding consistent habits across all website pages.</p>',5),c=[i];function r(l,p,m,d,g,h){return s(),t("div",null,c)}const b=e(a,[["render",r]]);export{_ as __pageData,b as default};
