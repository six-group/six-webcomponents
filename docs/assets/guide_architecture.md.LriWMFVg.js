Stencil is a compiler that generates Web Components (more specifically, Custom Elements) and builds high performance web apps. Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frameworks into a simple build-time tool. At the end everything will be compiled in a clean web component without any framework specific code - just pure JS and CSS. Additionally, there are so called <em>output-targets</em> which allow a very comfortable integration into all major frameworks.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="Stenciljs Architecture" title="Stenciljs Architecture">&quot;</p><p>Stencil takes features such as</p><ul><li>Virtual DOM</li><li>Async rendering (inspired by React Fiber)</li><li>Reactive data-binding</li><li>TypeScript</li><li>JSX</li><li>Static Site Generation (SSG)</li></ul><p>and then generates <strong>standards-based</strong> Web Components and web apps with these features baked in.</p><p>Except Stencil, our library doesn&#39;t have any other dependency.
