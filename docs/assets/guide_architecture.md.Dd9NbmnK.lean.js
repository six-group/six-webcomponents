Stencil is a compiler that generates Web Components (more specifically, Custom Elements) and builds high performance web apps. Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frameworks into a simple build-time tool. At the end everything will be compiled in a clean web component without any framework specific code - just pure JS and CSS.
